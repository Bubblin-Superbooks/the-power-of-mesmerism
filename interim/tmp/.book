He had the appearance of a man having strong\namorous</p>",
  "page-10": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">passions, but his manners were as gentle as those of a woman,\nand he was universally popular throughout the whole county.</p><p>His wife was a woman of unusual beauty. Descended from an old Spanish\nfamily, she had married when but sixteen years of age; Mr. Etheridge\nhaving met her at the house of some friends, and as they mutually fell\nin love with each other, their united entreaties overcame the objection\nraised on account of her youth, and in fact the warm blood that flowed\nin her veins had ripened her beauty to an extent almost unusual in\nthose of more phlegmatic races.</p><p>She was now in her thirty-fifth year, and in the full zenith of her\ncharms. An exquisitely shaped head graced a neck and shoulders white as\nalabaster, large liquid eyes, and long drooping lashes, a nose of\nperfect form, and two ruby pouting lips that seemed made to be kissed.</p>",
  "page-11": "<p>Her form was magnificent, of commanding height, widely spreading hips,\nand a bosom of massive proportions, the firmness of which rendered\nstays entirely unnecessary; a fact that was evident on watching the\nrise and fall of those two lovely globes, their form being perfectly\ndefined even to the nipples, beneath her well-fitting dress.</p><p>Her glance was electric, and it was impossible to meet her look\nunmoved, she exhaled an atmosphere of voluptuousness of the most\nmaddening force.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Her daughter Ethel, who had left school in Paris but a few months, was\nthe very counterpart of her lovely mother in her leading features. She\nhad just completed her seventeenth year, and was of tall, graceful\nstature, with a perfect figure. The smallness of her waist contrasted\nperfectly with the ravishing fullness of bosom and wideness of hips.\nShe had the liquid eyes of her mother, but they were suffused with a\nhumidity</p>",
  "page-12": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">that was perfectly maddening, and the expression of every\nfeature of her lovely face and palpitating form spoke of a warmth of\ntemperament and lascivious abandon that would have tempted an anchorite.</p><p>On a bright summer afternoon, in the year 18â€”, father, mother, and\ndaughter were waiting at the railway station, anxiously expecting the\narrival of the remaining member of the family, Frank, who, a year older\nthan Ethel, had been finishing his education in Germany, and was now\nreturning to take up his residence at Brackley.</p><p>At last the train arrived, and they hardly recognised the handsome,\ntall, and fine-looking young fellow who leaped out to greet them.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">A few hours after reaching the house the parents noted a peculiar\nchange that had taken place in their son. A dreamy languor seemed to\nhave taken possession of him, in place of the exuberant flow of animal\nspirits</p>",
  "page-13": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">that characterised him as a boy. He had a strange habit of\nlooking as though he were endeavouring to read the very thoughts of\nthose with whom he came in contact.</p><p>Mrs. Etheridge noticed this particularly, but thinking he was fatigued\nby his long journey, made no remark. But the most remarkable effect was\nproduced on Ethel; her brother seemed utterly unable to remove his eyes\nfrom her. Her singular beauty, and the nameless charm that pervaded\nher, seemed to have an irresistible attraction for him. Every time that\nhis eye rested on her she trembled violently, and seemed labouring\nunder some mysterious and powerful influence. Her lovely breasts\nheaved, and the humidity of her eyes increased, and she still seemed\nunusually excited after her brother had left the room in order to dress\nfor dinner.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Some friends had been invited to dine, and Frank found himself placed\nbetween his mother and sister. He glanced alternately at the two lovely\nbosoms, well</p>",
  "page-14": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">exposed by the low dresses each of them wore; and his face\nflushed, and he seemed for the moment about to faint, but almost\nimmediately recovering himself, he proceeded with his dinner and joined\nin the conversation.</p><p>In the course of the meal he ventured again to glance at his sister,\nand as she was leaning forward he saw the lovely valley between those\nhills of snow.</p><p>He accidentally pressed his knee against hers, she immediately looked\nat him fondly, and her breasts rose and fell tumultuously as she\nmechanically pressed closer to him.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Nothing further happened on this occasion, but they had a most charming\nevening in the drawing room, and Ethel and Frank seemed to have formed\na more than usually close friendship. They had not seen each other for\nfour years, and their reunion seemed a source of the greatest delight\nto both of them. Mrs. Etheridge</p>",
  "page-15": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">also inspired her son with the most\nintense affection.</p><p>Before retiring for the night Frank proposed an early walk on the\ngrounds, as he was anxious to renew his acquaintance with all the spots\nso attractive to him when a boy, and Ethel joyously assented. Six\no'clock was agreed to, which would leave them two good hours until\nbreakfast time.</p><p>When Ethel retired to rest she was in a state of wild excitement and\ncould not banish her darling brother's image from her thoughts.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">At length she fell into a troubled sleep, and after tossing wildly\nabout, awoke suddenly and found that she was spending, her nightdress\nand chemise were saturated, and her lovely cunt was throbbing with the\nextasy. She was no stranger to this sensation (as the reader will\nsubsequently learn), as she habitually produced the result with her\nfingers; but this emission seemed more madly exciting than any she had\never felt</p>",
  "page-16": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">before, and was produced without the usual means. At length\nshe fell asleep again, but dreamt continually of her brother.</p><p>He, for his part, was mentally exercising a power he had acquired in\nGermany (the peculiar circumstance of the manner in which he gained\nthis knowledge will be duly explained later on), and this was\nsufficient to account for his sister's condition.</p><p>Punctually at six o'clock on the following morning, brother and sister\nmet in the hall. She threw herself into his arms and embraced him with\ngreat affection. \"You darling brother,\" said she, \"how glad I am to\nhave you back with us; it seems like a new world to me.\"</p><p>\"My dearest sister,\" replied he, \"it is I who am the happy one, I\ncannot express to you the delight and happiness I feel in your society,\nafter so long an absence.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">After embracing again they started on their ramble;</p>",
  "page-17": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Ethel pointed out\nall her pet flowers and every spot that she liked, until they found\nthemselves, at length, in a charming little grove overhanging the beach.</p><p>\"Frank, darling,\" said she, \"I have a headache; shall we sit down here\nand rest a short time until it goes away?\"</p><p>\"Certainly, my darling, and I think I can relieve that headache by a\nsimple expedient I learned in Germany.\"</p><p>He then sat down opposite to her, and taking her two thumbs held them\nin the palm of his left hand, while with the right he made passes from\nher head to her feet, at the same time gazing into her eyes with a\nliterally devouring look.</p><p>As he proceeded the humidity in her lovely eyes increased until the\neyelids at last closed, and her head sank on her bosom.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">After continuing the passes for a short time longer, her brother, still\nkeeping his eyes fixed on her, gradually</p>",
  "page-18": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">allowed her hands to slip away\nfrom his, and fall on her lap. He appeared intensely excited, his\nnostrils were dilated, he breathed hard, and his eyes seemed to burn in\ntheir sockets.</p><p>He gently laid Ethel down on her back, and after waiting to satisfy\nhimself that she was in a fast mesmeric sleep, he placed one throbbing\nhand on her hip, and gradually raising it till he found the lovely\nprominence of one charming bosom, then his other hand sought its\ncompanion, and he pressed those heaving hills of snow which he felt\nperfectly under her thin muslin dress. He next knelt down by her side,\nand brought her breasts fully to view; they were indeed lovely, the two\nlittle pink nipples were stiffly erected, and seemed wooing to be\nkissed. She wore no stays, and his hand wandered over her lovely\nvelvety skin down to her enchanting belly. Then rising, he leant\nforwards and gradually raised her dress in front.</p>",
  "page-19": "<p>First, her lovely ankles were seen, then her swelling calves,\nbeautifully shaped knees, and glorious thighs. Frank felt faint and\nsick, and was compelled to desist from further exploration till he had\nsomewhat recovered.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">In a few moments he gently separated those divine thighs, and his eyes\nwere riveted on his sister's darling little cunt, which now lay fully\nexposed to view. Two lovely coral lips, which were slightly parted,\nmoist and throbbing, first met his gaze. He separated them yet further\nwith his finger and saw the exquisite clitoris perfectly visible.\nUtterly unable to resist the temptation, he glued his lips to the\nlovely spot, and titillated the clitoris with his tongue. Almost\nimmediately she began to writhe and twist about, and he felt her balmy\nemission flow into his mouth as she spent with low moans. He then\ndesisted, and releasing his bursting prick commenced slowly to frig\nhimself, while gazing</p>",
  "page-20": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">on the exquisite beauties exhibited to his view.\nWith spasmodic jerks the semen flew from him while he moaned with\npleasure.</p><p>Now fearing discovery, he carefully wiped his sister's cunt with his\nhandkerchief, which he madly kissed afterwards, and adjusted her dress,\nremoved all traces of his own spending, and proceeded to awaken his\nsister. Placing her in a sitting position against a tree, he\nrecommenced his passes, this time in a contrary direction, and she soon\nafter opened her eyes.</p><p>After looking at him vaguely for a moment, she flung her arms round his\nneck, and kissed him. \"Oh,\" she said, \"I have been asleep, and had such\na delicious dream.\"</p><p>\"Has your headache gone?\" said he.</p><p>\"Oh,\" she replied, \"I did have a headache, but not a symptom of it\nremains.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">She was evidently utterly unconscious of all that had</p>",
  "page-21": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">taken place, and\nher brother suggested they should resume their walk.</p><p>At breakfast Mrs. Etheridge said, \"You have had a walk betimes this\nmorning, my children, and you are both looking quite rosy.\"</p><p>So they were, but she little knew the cause.</p><p>After breakfast Mr. Etheridge addressed himself to his son, \"Your mamma\nand myself are obliged to go to Lynton this afternoon on family\nbusiness, and I fear we shall not be able to return until late, but I\nhave no doubt you will be able to amuse yourself; Ethel will, I am\nsure, do her best to keep you from getting dull on your first arrival\nat home, after so long an absence.\"</p><p>When they had started, Frank accompanied Ethel into her sitting room,\nand begged her to sing and play for him, in order that he might hear\nwhat progress she had made.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">She at once complied with his request, and he sat by</p>",
  "page-22": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">her side watching\nwith glaring eye the rise and fall of her lovely bosom as she sang him\na charming little song, full of simple natural tenderness. He was, in\nfact, lusting madly for his own sister, and why not?</p><p>In the earliest history of our own race incest was no sin; why should\nwe now consider it as such? On the other hand what can be more\nintensely exciting than the knowledge that one is indulging every\nfeeling of lasciviousness conjointly with one united so nearly by ties\nof blood and kindred.</p><p>When she had finished he burned to enjoy her, but dared not, and with\nan effort he left the room, saying that he had some letters to write.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">He went to his bedroom, but on his way thither he saw the adjoining\ndoor open and recognized a dress his sister had worn on the previous\nevening hanging against the wall. Her bed was still unmade, her\nnightdress was lying on it, and by the side of the bed a pair of\ndrawers</p>",
  "page-23": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">that she left there on changing her underlinen. He rushed to\nthe bed, kissed the nightdress, and literally glued his lips to that\nportion of her drawers which had covered her darling little cunt. He\nwas so excited that he could scarcely forbear from spending on the\nspot. Hearing approaching footsteps he immediately made his way to his\nown room, and bolting the door, he tore off his trousers. Doubling up\nthe pillow, he inserted his erect prick between the folds, and\nstraining it tightly between his thighs, threw himself forward on the\nbed, and thinking of his darling sister, with a few heaves backwards\nand forwards, spent deliciously. He then lay down and pondered over the\nbest means of attaining his desires, for he resolved that he would\nenjoy his sister in every conceivable manner, let the consequences be\nwhat they might.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">His meditations were interrupted by the luncheon bell. He descended to\nthe dining room, and the sight of</p>",
  "page-24": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">his sister aroused his desires with\nredoubled force; he devoured her with his eyes, and she again exhibited\nthe same restless and uncomfortable symptoms that possessed her in the\nmorning; her colour rose, her bosom rose and fell tumultuously, she\nsqueezed her thighs together, sighed deeply, and seemed altogether\nunlike herself.</p><p>Seeing this he averted his gaze, and commenced talking on indifferent\nsubjects. When the servants had left the room, he suggested another\nstroll on the grounds, as it was such a lovely afternoon. She consented\nwith delight, and they set forth.</p><p>After rambling some distance from the house, she said, \"Frank, my\ndarling, there is such a lovely summer house in this thicket where I\noften come and read, shall we go in and rest?\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Frank was delighted at the idea. It was a charming little retreat,\ncompletely hidden by trees, and furnished</p>",
  "page-25": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">most luxuriouslyâ€”a velvet\ncouch, an easy chair, and a lounge occupying the whole of one side\ninvited to repose.</p><p>They sat down, and Frank's arm wound round his sister's enticing waist,\nand he could not resist kissing those lovely pouting lips. She trembled\nlike an aspen, and as he gazed into her moist and humid eyes, the\nstrange symptoms reappeared.</p><p>Frank could no longer resist, but holding her thumbs he commenced the\nmagnetic passes, and she speedily fell into his arms, apparently in a\ndeep slumber. He now sought to see if he was entirely successful in his\nattempt to produce the effect he desired, and therefore taking her in\nhis arms and laying her on the couch, he said, \"Ethel, do you know\nwhere you are?\"</p><p>\"With my darling brother,\" she replied.</p><p>\"Do you love him?\"</p><p>\"Madly,\" was the reply.</p>",
  "page-26": "<p>\"What would you like to do to prove that love?\"</p><p>\"Anything he desires.\"</p><p>\"Stand up.\"</p><p>She did so.</p><p>\"Unfasten your dress; take it off.\"</p><p>She complied immediately.</p><p>\"Loosen your petticoats and take them off; now your slippers and your\nstockings.\"</p><p>The dear girl did exactly as requested, still in the same dreamy,\nlanguid manner. She now stood in her chemise and drawers only, and\nFrank felt as if he would faint. This splendid girl standing before\nhim; lovely ankles, calves, and bare feet and those enchanting breasts\npeeping over her embroidered chemise, constituted a most voluptuous\nsight.</p><p>\"Now, my darling,\" said he, \"remove your drawers.\"</p><p>She did so, and he snatched them up and covered them with kisses.</p>",
  "page-27": "<p>\"Now the chemise.\"</p><p>That also was taken off with alacrity, and she was before him perfectly\nnaked. Heavens! What a sight! The whiteness of her skin, which shone\nlike alabaster, the exquisite contour of her limbs, and the tremulous\nmotion which pervaded every muscle, formed a combination of lustful\nexcitement that utterly baffles description.</p><p>He then ordered her to lie down on her back, raise her knees, and place\nher heels against her buttocks, then insert her finger in that divine\ncunt and frig herself.</p><p>She did so.</p><p>\"How do you feel, darling? Are you going to spend? I will that you\nspend at once.\"</p><p>Her whole body stiffened.</p><p>\"Keep your thighs widely extended,\" he said, \"so that I can see every\nthrob that convulses your cunt, when the lovely liquor of love oozes\nforth.\"</p>",
  "page-28": "<p>She obeyed, and with a deep sigh he saw it gush forth and cover her\ncaressing hand.</p><p>He rushed forward and gamahuched her furiously, and then sitting in an\neasy chair, said, \"Ethel, get up.\"</p><p>She obeyed, and following his commands, knelt in front of him,\nunfastened the front of his trousers, inserted her hand, and drew forth\nhis prick; she then sucked it until with a positive howl of delight he\ninundated her mouth with his spendings. He then desired her to rise and\nkneel on the couch, then coming behind her he gently pulled apart the\ncheeks of her divine bottom, and disclosed the little orifice that lay\nnestling between them. This he sucked till he spent again, clasping her\nhips as he spent with spasmodic force.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">He burned to fuck her, but dared not venture, and after a short time he\nordered her to resume her clothes, and then repeated the passes in a\ncontrary direction</p>",
  "page-29": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">until she recovered her senses, and to his great\ndelight, she evidently knew nothing of what had taken place.</p><p>Mr. and Mrs. Etheridge had not returned when they reached the house,\nand they found a note stating that they were detained and could not be\nhome till the following day.</p><p>On reading this Frank immediately remembered the proximity of his\nsister's bedroom and determined, at any risk, to gratify his intense\ndesire with respect to her, this very night.</p><p>Before retiring he embraced her warmly, pressing her breasts against\nhis chest and pushing his belly against hers; to his intense delight he\nfelt her whole frame vibrate from the intensity of her emotion as her\nhead fell on his shoulder.</p><p>He bade her good night and departed to his room.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">As soon as he was convinced the house was quiet he gently opened his\ndoor and stole on tiptoe to his sister's</p>",
  "page-30": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">room. To his intense delight\nit was unfastened.</p><p>He entered and saw his sister lying on her snowy bed, which was\nillumined by the rays of the moon.</p><p>She slept; he watched for some moments the rise and fall of her bosom,\nand the exquisite beauty of her face, and then commenced to mesmerize\nher again. She moaned faintly, and appeared restless.</p><p>\"Sleep,\" said he, and she immediately became quiet.</p><p>\"Ethel,\" he continued, \"do you know who is speaking to you?\"</p><p>\"Yes, my darling brother.\"</p><p>He next pulled down the bed-clothes, and gently placed himself by her\nside, naked as he was.</p><p>\"My darling,\" said he, \"take off your night dress and chemise.\"</p><p>She raised herself in the bed and did so, and then lay down again.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">He clasped her in his arms, utterly intoxicated with</p>",
  "page-31": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">his anticipated\nbliss.</p><p>The contact of her skin with his own, the knowledge that she was\nunconscious of what he was doing, and that it was his own sister,\nalmost maddened him.</p><p>He was literally consumed with lust, and embraced her in every\ndirection. Passing his arms between her thighs, he nestled his head on\nher divine belly. He next shifted it to her bosom, then he placed his\nprick between those firm and pouting breasts, then between her thighs.\nHe next placed his finger inside the lips of her cunt, and found to his\nsurprise that it entered easily.</p><p>\"Thank God,\" he muttered, \"she has been frigged, possibly fucked, and I\nshall not hurt her.\"</p><p>He willed her to take his prick and insert it in that divine recess,\nand to his intense joy he succeeded in burying himself in her with\nscarcely any difficulty.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">He then lay powerless, and the spasm overtook him and ebbed forth into\nthe inmost recesses of his sister's</p>",
  "page-32": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">cunt.</p><p>He lay for a few moments in a profound lethargy, when he suddenly found\nhis sister's cunt contracting and throbbing around his prick, which was\nstill soaking within her. This fired him anew, and placing both hands\nbeneath her buttocks, he pressed her cunt towards him with the utmost\nforce, while driving in and out of her with deep and body-killing\nthrusts. They both spent simultaneously, and after a short pause he\narose and contemplated her, then willing her to resume her night dress\nand chemise, he returned to his own room, fearing that he might fall\nasleep and be discovered in the morning.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">As he lay down he noticed a ray of light in a dark corner of his room,\nand on examining the panelling, found that a crevice existed through\nwhich he could see perfectly into his sister's room.

  "page-33": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">he had\nforgotten to awaken her from the magnetic sleep which evidently still\noverpowered her.</p><p>He immediately commenced the necessary process and, to his delight,\nfound that it had the same effect, notwithstanding the wall which\nintervened.</p><p>She rose in the bed, and altering her position, lay calmly and\nnaturally.</p><p>He retired to bed again, but was restless and excited and could not\nsleep; his prick was still stiff, and every nerve throbbed.</p><p>He lay tossing about in this way for an hour or so, when he suddenly\nheard a sound of whispering in the next room, and on peeping through\nthe crevice into his sister's apartment, beheld a sight that rendered\nhim spellbound and breathless.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">He saw on her bed a figure perfectly naked, and of the most exquisite\nform, rivalling that of Ethel herself.

Oh! Oh! Suck harder, my dear.\" He now recognised the stranger as\na housemaid who had attracted his attention on more than one occasion\nduring the short time he had been in the house.</p><p>His sister now sought Mabel's cunt, and inserting a finger, commenced\npushing it backwards and forwards as she embraced her lovely buttocks\nwith her disengaged arm, burying her tongue within the rosy bottom-hole.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">They writhed like two serpents, their bodies arched, and then they fell\nprone on each other, every muscle</p>",

  "page-36": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">sound of their mutual sucking, as\ntheir heads were between each other's thighs, drove Frank almost to the\nverge of distraction.</p><p>They swayed to and fro, and pressed each other with their utmost\nstrength, until it was evident they were spending again.

  "page-39": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">in a moist and spending condition.</p><p>She tore open his trousers, saying, \"Oh!

He resisted the impulse to follow her example, and\nseating himself in a chair, drew her towards him, placed his knees\nbetween her thighs, and allowed her gradually to sit down, while his\nprick penetrated her.</p><p>They embraced madly, thrusting their tongues into each other's mouths,\nand even biting each other in the fury of their transports, until\nanother emission relieved their feverish lubricity.</p><p>They then resumed their position on the couch, and Ethel burst into a\nflood of tears.</p>",

The walls were hung with pictures of the most\nexciting character, and in the centre of the room was a huge bed,\ncovered with crimson velvet and stuffed with down, but without any of\nthe ordinary bed-clothing, instead there were a quantity of cushions\nvariously shaped and also covered with velvet.
