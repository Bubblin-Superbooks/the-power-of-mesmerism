<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent stretch-last-line ">please,
for I know I'm extreamly To blame, thus to blurt out a word so
unseemly. But all know the proverb, wherein it is said, That a What is
a What, and a Spade is a Spade; And now I'm provok'd, for a truth I may
tell it, Tho' as red as a fox, yet it smells like a vi'let. By Jove
I'll be judge, if I am not as sweet, I may say, as a primrose, from
head to my feet. And he, you may swear, who's my husband and lover, Has
kist me, and felt me, and smelt me all over, And if he can say an ill
scent does arise, From my ears, or my armpits, my c——t, or my thighs,
Like rotten old Cheshire, low Vervane or Ling, And altho' I'm goddess,
I'll hang in a string. Your self, Lady Fair, that arose from the sea,
Sure will not presume to be fragrant as me: The spark that has laid at
your feet all his trophies, Has smelt you sometimes strong as pickl'd
anchovies: But what if he has, were you ranker and older, You'd be e'en
good enough for a smith or a soldier." These words put the Goddess of
Love in a fire,</p></div> </div>
