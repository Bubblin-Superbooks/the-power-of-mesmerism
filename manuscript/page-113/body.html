knew, when he took a survey, Of those parts where a Goddess's
excellence lay; Who strok'd it and smil'd, when my legs he had parted,
And peep'd till I thought his poor eyes would have started. Then
licking his lips, did aver to be true, I was each way as full well
accomplish'd as you. Indeed, Madam Juno, I'll therefore be plain, If
ever I hear these reflections again: I vow as a Goddess, and no mortal
sinner, I shall have no patience, but handle your pinner." With that

ready to bang her. "Pox take ye," says he, "is your scolding a lecture,
That ought to be preach'd o'er a bowl of good nectar? To drink we came
hither, to sing and be civil; As gods, to be merry, and not play the
devil. Why, mortals on earth, that live crowded in allies, As
laundresses, porters, poor strumpets and bullies; When got o'er a
gallon of belch, or a sneaker Of punch, could not wrangle more</p></div> </div>
