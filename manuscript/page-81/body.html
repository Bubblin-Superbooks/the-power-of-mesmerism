position all of a sudden, she forced her head between Ethel's thighs
and commenced to suck her cunt, plunging her amorous velvety-tipped
tongue in as far as it would go, or biting the little clitoris in such
a way that her companion was almost mad with a feeling she could not

semblance of resistance—the last faint protest of her modest nature
before thoroughly surrendering herself to all the voluptuous games of
Minette.</p><p>At last her head fell back, her throbbing cunt was raised to meet those
warm, loving kisses, and then for the first time in her life, she
really spent—and fainted.</p><p>When she recovered she threw herself into Minette's arms, saying, "Oh,
I have indeed been in heaven. What did you do to make me feel so?"</p></div> </div>
