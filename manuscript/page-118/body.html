<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent stretch-last-line ">Whore for your wife, Pray is that any comfort or
ease to your life; And have made it appear to the Gods as a jest, That
your wife's reputation is none of the best; Does that make your labour
more easy or sweet, Or give you more gust to your drink or your meat?
'Tis true, you are fam'd for the net you have made, Pray what did you
catch in't but horns for your head; You know that your rival don't
value a trap, Or a net, any more than a child or a clap; A soldier is
never asham'd of his vices, But rather is proud of a Goddess's kisses;
And thinks it adds more to a hero's renown, To subdue a fair lady than
conquer a town; Your spite must be therefore intended alone, Against
me, and that my little faults might be known; Since 'tis as it is, I am
very well pleas'd, Your head shall be loaded, my tail shall be eas'd;
For since you have publish'd my shame and disgrace, And have made me a
jest to the heavenly race; I'll be impudent now, and whenever I meet,
My dear favourite Mars, tho' it be in</p></div> </div>
