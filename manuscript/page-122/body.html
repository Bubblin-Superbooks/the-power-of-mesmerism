where the groom Thomas, a fine handsome young fellow of about twenty,
was polishing the coats of his charges, at the same time as he emitted
that curious hissing which all stablemen so mysteriously accustom

appointments. Then he conducted them into the harness room, which was
at the top of a short flight of stairs.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Thomas was about to close an interior door, which half open gave a view
into his own private quarters,</p></div> </div>
