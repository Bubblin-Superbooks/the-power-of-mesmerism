handsome youth of seventeen, with golden coloured hair, the bloom of
the peach on his cheeks, and a most loveable pair of deep blue eyes
which seemed full of the humid fire of love. He had also a finely
developed form, which his close-fitting garments set off to the best
advantage, and, above all, what had the most charm for the eyes of his
friends as they so heartily welcomed him to their house was the evident
precocity of his organs of love, which in their quiescent state showed
a most prominent lump in his trousers.</p><p>Mrs. Etheridge: "Why Harry, what a fine fellow you have grown since I
saw you a year ago. No doubt you are too bashful to kiss Ethel now, but
you will surely embrace an old friend like me, who used to nurse you in
my arms as a baby," giving him such an amorous hug and smack upon his
cheeks that the young fellow blushed up to his eyes.</p></div> </div>
