near, I will never more dally, He shall, if it pleases him, ay marry
shall he; Thus all you shall get by your open detection, Of one silly
error in female affection, Is a wife that will cuckold you worse out of
spite, Now she's catch'd, than before she e're did for delight; To
punish thy head and heart, that very vice, Which I us'd but in private
whilst honour was nice; I'll publickly now practice over and o'er, Till
thou'rt fain'd for a Cuckold and I for a Whore." Cries Vulcan, "Could
ever man think that a Goddess, Admir'd for her charms by such numbers
of noddies, Should ever be curst with so rampant a tail, That will
wallow more love-sap, than I can do ale; A pox on your rump, for I
plainly see 'tis As salt as your parents, Oceanus and Tethys. But had I
first known you had sprung from salt water, The Devil for me, should
have marry'd the daughter; Besides, you are grown both so lustful and
bold, And for all your sweet looks, have a Billingsgate tongue, That is
fifty times</p></div> </div>
