believe that. I ain't afraid. You may try."</p><p>Frank: "Then look me steadily in the face, and let me hold you by your
two thumbs."</p><p>Thomas: "All right, sir, but I be sure you can't make me do as you say."</p><p>For a little while he resisted the effects of Frank's mesmeric art, but
in less than five minutes his eyes had a quite vacant look, and in
obedience to his young master he seated himself on the side of the bed.</p><p>"Now, Harry, let me do you as well, as I have an idea I want to carry
out."</p><p>"You may take hold of my thumbs as you did with Thomas, but I defy you
to mesmerize me," said Harry, laughing.</p><p>"That's too bad," replied Frank with a smile, "but there's no harm in
trying what I can do, old fellow, eh?"</p></div> </div>
