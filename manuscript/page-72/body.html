 How oft I'm baffled since my hopes began!</p><p>I will not, cannot tell, for very shame,
 All that is wanting to the married state,
To be a wife in nothing but the name,
 Is a most wretched, miserable fate!</p><p>Though chaste in heart, and willing to be chaste,
 What virtue can withstand the waltz's whirl?
Tom, Jack, or Harry's arm about my waist,
 Belly to belly throbbing, boy with girl!</p><p>To sup on partridges and to drink champagne,
 Stirs my hot blood to fever's ardent glow,
And then the waltzing round and round again,
 Drives me quite mad! O what, what can I do?</p><p>I'd willingly be wise and chaste, God knows!
 But O, it drives me wild with amorous pain,
To feel the embracing arms of waltzing beaux,
 To meet the piercing glance of charming men!</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">O, tell me, have I err'd? Impart the truth!
